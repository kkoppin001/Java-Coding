# Word Game Project  

## Project Description  

This program involves one turn in a simple word game based on one from the New York Times
called *Spelling Bee.* In this game, a user tries to make as many valid words as possible from a list of letters 
to get the highest score that they can. This project has use of ArrayLists, methods for various functions, and the use
of input/output work with files.

## Project Guide

### Dependencies  

What is needed to run this code, you need a supported Integrated Development Environment(*IDE*), a text file
titled "*words.txt*" that lists many words to choose from and it needs to be in the same directory as the coding file, and the JDK Extension as this is a Java-based program

### How to run the project  

If a *Run button* is not available, like it usually is in **Visual Studio Code** in the top right corner, 
you can type two commands into the terminal, also known as the command line.

The two commands that you will want to use, and order does matter, first, "**javac wordGame.java**" to compile the program, and then "**java wordGame.java**" second to run it.
Then the program should run accordingly.

### How to play the game  

In order to play the game, a list of 6 letters will appear on the screen in the terminal. In order to gain points, you have to use the
letters given and then try and make words using those letters, and letters can be used more than once. 4 letters words are worth 1 point, 
and then after that, however many letters you use greater than 4, you get that many points.

There are also certain commands that you can use as functions to help you with playing the game.

**ls**: can be used to list all of the words that you have typed out already so you do not repeat words

**mix**: can be used to shuffle the letters already given if you are struggling to find words

**bye**: will terminate the program and then the game will end


The last lesson That I learned was the use of ArrayLists especially with the use of lists made up of Strings and made up of characters specifically. It was difficult to 
sometimes to differentiate between the two, but it was a good learning curve of why lists made up of characters would be better for some things while some made up 
of strings would be better for others.
